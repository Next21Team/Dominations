# Dominations

_**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)_

AMX Mod X plugin for Counter-Strike.

This plugin is a simple domination system like Team Fortress 2. If a player kills another player several times in a row, then the killer is counted as dominating his victim. Revenge is an event in which a player dominated by an enemy was able to kill him. Dominance is accompanied by text chat messages and related sounds from Team Fortress 2.

## Cvars
- ```dominations_frags "3"``` Kills before dominance.
- ```dominations_sounds "1"``` Enable/disable sounds.
- ```dominations_team "1"``` Do not count domination between players on the same team.
